# guitar practice

- works with extended range guitars
- change scale, tuning, mode

another significant part is the notation -- sharps and flats are changed to remove two issues; redudancy (two names for one note) and a name that is more than one symbol long

borrowing some math notation and recognizing the piano has a group of 2 black keys and a group of 3 black keys, using (U, V) and (X, Y, Z) made sense, for the purpose of only having to relearn those notes instead of an entire new system
